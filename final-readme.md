# PromptForge Final Session README

Session date: May 17, 2026

This file summarizes the deployment work completed in today's PromptForge session.

---

## What Changed Today

The main focus was preparing PromptForge for deployment as a complete Week 28 AI platform.

The platform already had:

- FastAPI backend
- JWT authentication
- Prompt versioning
- Workspace collaboration
- Approval workflows
- LangGraph evaluation
- LangSmith tracing support
- Qdrant semantic search
- Streamlit dashboard
- A/B testing
- Analytics
- Docker Compose local deployment

Today's work did not rebuild those systems. It added deployment documentation and cloud-ready configuration support.

---

## Files Added

### `DEPLOYMENT_README.md`

Added a full deployment guide explaining how to deploy PromptForge using:

- Streamlit Community Cloud for the frontend
- Render for the FastAPI backend
- Neon for PostgreSQL
- Qdrant Cloud for vector search
- Optional LangSmith tracing

The guide includes:

- deployment architecture
- step-by-step deployment process
- required environment variables
- what not to commit to GitHub
- which code files matter for deployment
- smoke test steps
- common deployment issues
- final checklist
- explanation points for students

### `final-readme.md`

Added this summary file to document what changed in this session.

---

## Files Updated

### `README.md`

Added a deployment guide section that points students to:

```text
DEPLOYMENT_README.md
```

This makes the Week 28 deployment instructions easy to find from the main project README.

### `.env.example`

Added Qdrant Cloud environment variables:

```text
QDRANT_URL=
QDRANT_API_KEY=
```

These are placeholders only. Real API keys must be added in hosting dashboards, not committed to GitHub.

### `app/core/config.py`

Added backend settings for Qdrant Cloud:

```python
QDRANT_URL: str = ""
QDRANT_API_KEY: str = ""
```

This allows the same backend code to run locally with Docker Qdrant or in the cloud with Qdrant Cloud.

### `app/services/vector_service.py`

Updated Qdrant connection logic.

The backend now checks:

```text
If QDRANT_URL exists -> connect to Qdrant Cloud
Otherwise -> connect to local Qdrant host and port
```

This keeps local Docker development working while enabling cloud deployment.

### `docker-compose.yml`

Added these environment variables to the backend service:

```text
QDRANT_URL
QDRANT_API_KEY
```

Local Docker still uses:

```text
QDRANT_HOST=qdrant
QDRANT_PORT=6333
```

## What Was Not Included

The following should not be pushed to GitHub:

- `.env`
- real `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- real `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`
- real `QDRANT_API_KEY`
- real production `SECRET_KEY`
- Neon database password
- local database files
- Docker volumes
- Python cache files
- local smoke test databases
- private live scripts

Only templates and documentation should contain variable names.

## Deployment Flow To Explain To Students

Local development runs everything together:

```text
docker compose up --build
```

Cloud deployment separates every service:

```text
Streamlit Cloud
  -> Render FastAPI backend
       -> Neon PostgreSQL
       -> Qdrant Cloud
       -> Optional LangSmith
```

The main teaching point:

```text
Production-style AI platforms are not one single app.
They are multiple services connected through APIs, databases, vector stores, and environment variables.
```

## Validation Completed

The following checks were run:

```powershell
python -m compileall app frontend
docker compose config
```

Both checks passed.

---

## Intended Commit Contents

The deployment commit should include only:

```text
.env.example
README.md
DEPLOYMENT_README.md
final-readme.md
app/core/config.py
app/services/vector_service.py
docker-compose.yml
```

Existing local deletions such as old week files should not be staged unless intentionally requested.
